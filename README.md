# zkp rust tutorial
This tutorial aims to provide zkp samples and benches implemented in rust. Some famous/great libraries will be included for studying such as bellman/bellperson/bls12_381/blstrs etc. Also some basic cryto algorithm such as fintefield/group/polynomial/ecdsa/schnor/elgamal/ecdh will be included. Any new but related library or tools are welcomed to be added here for test/demo/benchmark/tutorial. To help understanding, you will see some tutorials coming up with both rust and python/sage.

### Why rust
Rust now is the first priority choice for arbitrary complicated algorithm implmentation. As we can see, especially in zkp more and more tools and libraries including bellman/filecoin/merlin/plonky are implmented in rust.

### Why python/sage
Python is certainly good language for tutuorial and educating. Sage is a powerful tool with lots of algorithm integrated to demo zkp.

### benchmark and demo
